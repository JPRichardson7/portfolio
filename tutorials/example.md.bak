# Building Component-Based Navigation Lists: From Repetition to Data-Driven

## Learning Goals

Transform repetitive navigation HTML into a maintainable, component-based system using Jekyll includes and data files. Learn when and how to extract components, implement data-driven loops, and create scalable navigation patterns that professional development teams use.

**Core Philosophy**: Build using professional patterns immediately - start with the simplest component approach, then enhance with data-driven generation for optimal maintainability.

---

## Challenge 1: The Navigation List Component Problem (4 minutes)

### The Problem

You have navigation links that follow the same HTML pattern but require manual updates in multiple places when you add or change pages. You need to create a reusable component for navigation items that eliminates repetition.

### Learning Target

**Component extraction for repeated patterns** - Learning to identify repetitive HTML patterns and extract them into reusable Jekyll components

### Your Challenge

Extract your repetitive navigation links into a reusable Jekyll component that you can use consistently across your navigation, eliminating the need to write the same HTML structure multiple times.

### Concepts You'll Need

- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying what changes vs what stays the same in repeated HTML
- **Jekyll includes**: `{% include component.html %}` with parameters
- **Component parameters**: Passing data like `url` and `text` to components
- **Active state handling**: Managing current page highlighting

**How Jekyll Component Parameters Work:**

Jekyll lets you pass information to components using a simple pattern:
```html
{% include component.html parameter="value" %}
```

Inside the component, you access these with `{{ include.parameter }}`.

**Conditional Content in Jekyll:**
```html
{% if include.something %}add this content{% endif %}
```
- **If `something` was passed**: Jekyll adds the content
- **If `something` wasn't passed**: Jekyll adds nothing (empty string)

**Example with a button component:**
```html
<!-- Component call -->
{% include button.html text="Submit" primary=true %}

<!-- Inside button component -->
<button class="btn{% if include.primary %} btn-primary{% endif %}">
  {{ include.text }}
</button>

<!-- Result -->
<button class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
```

### Hints

1. Look at your navigation links - what parts change between each link?
2. Create a component that accepts the changing parts as parameters
3. Replace your repeated HTML with multiple component includes
4. Consider how to handle the "active" state for the current page

### Try It First

Take 3 minutes to create a reusable navigation item component.

### Test Your Solution

Your navigation should render the same links but use component includes instead of repetitive HTML. You should see:
- Same visual navigation list as before
- No repetitive HTML in your navigation markup
- Easy way to add new navigation items
- Clear pattern for handling active states

### Solution

Create `portfolio/_includes/components/nav-item.html`:

```html
<li class="nav-item{% if include.active %} active{% endif %}">
  <a href="{{ include.url }}" 
     class="nav-link"
     {% if include.active %}aria-current="page"{% endif %}>
    {{ include.text }}
  </a>
</li>
```

**How the Active State Logic Works:**

The `{% if include.active %} active{% endif %}` pattern is Jekyll's way of conditionally adding content:

1. **`include.active`** - This checks if the "active" parameter was passed to the component
2. **If true** - Jekyll adds " active" to the class list
3. **If false/missing** - Jekyll adds nothing (empty string)

**Examples of how this renders:**

```html
<!-- When you call: {% include nav-item.html active=true %} -->
<li class="nav-item active">

<!-- When you call: {% include nav-item.html %} (no active parameter) -->
<li class="nav-item">
```

**The ARIA attribute works the same way:**
- `{% if include.active %}aria-current="page"{% endif %}`
- **If active=true**: Adds `aria-current="page"` for screen readers
- **If no active parameter**: Adds nothing

**Why This Pattern Matters:**
- **CSS targeting**: You can style `.nav-item.active` differently
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers know which page is current
- **Flexibility**: Component works with or without active state

Update your navigation list to use the component:

```html
<ul class="nav-list">
  {% include components/nav-item.html url="/" text="HOME" %}
  {% include components/nav-item.html url="/ux-ui/" text="UX/UI" %}
  {% include components/nav-item.html url="/development/" text="DEVELOPMENT" %}
  {% include components/nav-item.html url="/visual-design/" text="VISUAL DESIGN" active=true %}
  {% include components/nav-item.html url="/photography/" text="PHOTOGRAPHY" %}
  {% include components/nav-item.html url="/about/" text="ABOUT" %}
  {% include components/nav-item.html url="/resume/" text="GET RESUME" %}
</ul>
```

**How the Component Calls Work:**

Each `{% include %}` passes different parameters:
- **`url="/visual-design/"`** → becomes `{{ include.url }}` in the component
- **`text="VISUAL DESIGN"`** → becomes `{{ include.text }}` in the component  
- **`active=true`** → becomes `{{ include.active }}` in the component (only on that one item)

**The Result:**
Only the "VISUAL DESIGN" item gets the extra CSS class and accessibility attribute because it's the only one with `active=true`.

### Why This Approach

Component extraction eliminates repetitive HTML immediately, making changes easier and reducing errors. The parameter system (`url`, `text`, `active`) handles the variations between navigation items while maintaining consistent structure and accessibility features.

### Challenge Questions

1. What are the benefits of using parameters (`include.url`, `include.text`) instead of hard-coding values?
2. Why handle the active state within the component rather than in the calling code?
3. How does this approach make navigation maintenance easier?

#### Answers

1. Parameters make the component reusable for any navigation item. Hard-coding would require separate components for each link, defeating the purpose of component extraction and creating maintenance overhead.

2. Handling active state in the component ensures **both** the CSS class **and** the accessibility attribute get added together consistently. If you handled active state in the calling code, you'd need to remember to add both `class="active"` and `aria-current="page"` every time, creating opportunities for errors where visual and accessibility features get out of sync.

3. This approach centralizes navigation item structure - changing link markup, adding accessibility features, or updating styling requires updating only one file instead of seven separate HTML blocks. For example, if you wanted to add an icon to all navigation items, you'd update the component once rather than finding and updating seven different HTML locations.

## Challenge 2: The Data-Driven Navigation Problem (5 minutes)

### The Problem

Your component-based navigation is much better, but you still have repetitive component includes and need to manually update the navigation list when adding pages. You need a data-driven approach that generates navigation from a centralized data source.

### Learning Target

**Data-driven component generation** - Using Jekyll data files and loops to automatically generate navigation components from structured data

### Your Challenge

Create a data file for your navigation items and use Jekyll's loop functionality to automatically generate navigation components, eliminating manual component includes and centralizing navigation management.

### Concepts You'll Need

- **Jekyll data files**: YAML files in `_data/` folder for structured content
- **Liquid loops**: `{% for item in data %}` to iterate over data collections
- **Data structure design**: Organizing navigation data for easy maintenance
- **Dynamic active state**: Determining current page programmatically

**How Jekyll Data Files Work:**

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is Jekyll's way of storing structured data:

1. **Each `-` creates a new item** in a list
2. **Indentation matters** - properties under each `-` belong to that item
3. **`property: "value"`** creates key-value pairs
4. **Jekyll automatically** makes this available as `site.data.filename`

**Example YAML structure for blog posts:**
```yaml
- title: "My First Post"
  date: "2024-01-15"
- title: "Learning Jekyll"
  date: "2024-02-20"
```
**Becomes accessible as:** `site.data.posts` (if file is `posts.yml`)

**How Liquid Loops Work:**
```html
{% for post in site.data.posts %}
  <!-- This code runs once for each post -->
  <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2> <!-- Outputs "My First Post", then "Learning Jekyll" -->
{% endfor %}
```

**Creating Variables in Liquid:**
```html
{% assign is_featured = false %}
{% if post.date == "2024-02-20" %}
  {% assign is_featured = true %}
{% endif %}
```
- **`{% assign %}`** creates a new variable
- **Variables persist** throughout the template
- **`page.url`** is Jekyll's automatic variable for current page URL

### Hints

1. Create a YAML data file with your navigation items and their properties
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the data and generate components
3. Structure your data to include all necessary information (URL, text, etc.)
4. Consider how to determine which item should be active automatically

### Try It First

Take 4 minutes to create a data-driven navigation system.

### Test Your Solution

Your navigation should render exactly the same but be generated from data. You should see:
- Same navigation list appearance and functionality
- No repetitive component includes in your HTML
- Easy way to add navigation items by editing data file only
- Centralized navigation management

### Solution

Create `portfolio/_data/navigation.yml`:

```yaml
- text: "HOME"
  url: "/"
  
- text: "UX/UI"
  url: "/ux-ui/"
  
- text: "DEVELOPMENT"
  url: "/development/"
  
- text: "VISUAL DESIGN"
  url: "/visual-design/"
  
- text: "PHOTOGRAPHY"
  url: "/photography/"
  
- text: "ABOUT"
  url: "/about/"
  
- text: "GET RESUME"
  url: "/resume/"
```

**How YAML Data Files Work:**

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is Jekyll's way of storing structured data:

1. **Each `-` creates a new item** in a list
2. **Indentation matters** - properties under each `-` belong to that item
3. **`property: "value"`** creates key-value pairs
4. **Jekyll automatically** converts this into data you can access

**What Jekyll Does With This File:**
- Reads `_data/navigation.yml`
- Creates `site.data.navigation` array
- Each item becomes accessible with properties like `item.text` and `item.url`

Update your navigation list to use data-driven generation:

```html
<ul class="nav-list">
  {% for item in site.data.navigation %}
    {% assign is_active = false %}
    {% if page.url == item.url %}
      {% assign is_active = true %}
    {% endif %}
    
    {% include components/nav-item.html 
       url=item.url 
       text=item.text 
       active=is_active %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

**How the Loop Logic Works:**

Let's break down each part of this complex template:

**1. The For Loop:**
```html
{% for item in site.data.navigation %}
```
- **`site.data.navigation`** - Jekyll automatically makes your YAML file available here
- **`for item in`** - Creates a temporary variable called `item` for each list entry
- **Loop behavior** - Runs the code inside once for each navigation item

**2. The Variable Assignment:**
```html
{% assign is_active = false %}
{% if page.url == item.url %}
  {% assign is_active = true %}
{% endif %}
```
- **`{% assign %}`** - Creates a new variable in Liquid templates
- **`page.url`** - Jekyll automatically provides the current page's URL
- **`item.url`** - Gets the URL from your YAML data for this specific item
- **The logic** - If current page matches this navigation item's URL, mark it as active

**3. The Component Call:**
```html
{% include components/nav-item.html 
   url=item.url 
   text=item.text 
   active=is_active %}
```
- **`item.url`** - Pulls the `url` property from the current YAML item
- **`item.text`** - Pulls the `text` property from the current YAML item
- **`is_active`** - Uses the variable we just calculated above

**What This Generates:**

For the "VISUAL DESIGN" item when you're on the `/visual-design/` page:
```html
<li class="nav-item active">
  <a href="/visual-design/" class="nav-link" aria-current="page">
    VISUAL DESIGN
  </a>
</li>
```

For all other items:
```html
<li class="nav-item">
  <a href="/ux-ui/" class="nav-link">
    UX/UI
  </a>
</li>
```

### Why This Approach

Data-driven navigation separates content from presentation, making maintenance easier and reducing errors. Adding new pages requires only updating the data file, while navigation structure and styling remain centralized in components.

### Challenge Questions

1. How does separating navigation data from HTML markup improve maintainability?
2. What happens when you need to add a new page to your portfolio?
3. Why use `{% assign is_active = ... %}` instead of checking active state directly in the component?

#### Answers

1. Separating data from markup means content changes (adding pages, updating URLs) don't require touching HTML/component code. This reduces errors and makes navigation management a content task rather than a development task.

2. Adding a new page requires only adding one entry to the YAML data file. The navigation automatically includes the new item without any HTML changes, demonstrating how data-driven approaches scale efficiently.

3. Active state logic in the template keeps the component pure and reusable. The component focuses on presentation while the template handles business logic, following separation of concerns principles used in professional development.

## Challenge 3: The Enhanced Data Structure Problem (4 minutes)

### The Problem

Your data-driven navigation works well, but you realize you need additional properties for some navigation items (like external links, different styling, or grouping). You need to enhance your data structure to support more complex navigation requirements while maintaining simplicity.

### Learning Target

**Scalable data architecture** - Designing data structures that support current needs while accommodating future requirements without breaking existing functionality

### Your Challenge

Enhance your navigation data structure to support additional properties like external links, custom styling, or metadata, while maintaining backward compatibility with your existing component system.

### Concepts You'll Need

- **YAML data modeling**: Adding optional properties to data structures
- **Conditional logic**: Using `if` statements to handle optional data
- **Component flexibility**: Making components handle variable data gracefully
- **Default values**: Providing sensible defaults for optional properties

**How Optional Properties Work in YAML:**

You can add properties to some items but not others:
```yaml
- name: "John"
  email: "john@example.com"      # Just basic properties

- name: "Sarah"  
  email: "sarah@example.com"
  manager: true                  # Additional property
  department: "engineering"      # Another additional property
```

**How Jekyll Handles Missing Properties:**
- **If item has the property**: `person.manager` returns the value (`true`)
- **If item doesn't have the property**: `person.manager` returns `null`
- **In conditionals**: `{% if person.manager %}` treats `null` as `false`

**Multiple Conditional Classes:**
```html
<div class="person{% if include.featured %} featured{% endif %}{% if include.manager %} manager{% endif %}">
```
- **Each `{% if %}`** conditionally adds a class
- **Result**: Could be `class="person"` or `class="person featured manager"`

**Dynamic String Building:**
```html
<span class="badge badge--{{ include.department }}"></span>
```
- **`{{ include.department }}`** inserts the actual value
- **If `department: "engineering"`**: becomes `class="badge badge--engineering"`
- **CSS can target**: `.badge--engineering` specifically

**Security Attributes for External Links:**
- **`target="_blank"`** - Opens in new tab
- **`rel="noopener"`** - Prevents new tab from accessing original page (security)

### Hints

1. Add optional properties to your data file for items that need them
2. Update your component to handle the new properties conditionally
3. Ensure existing navigation items continue working without changes
4. Consider what future navigation needs might require

### Try It First

Take 3 minutes to enhance your data structure for more complex navigation needs.

### Test Your Solution

Your navigation should work exactly as before, but now support enhanced features. You should see:
- All existing navigation items working unchanged
- Ability to specify external links, custom classes, or other metadata
- Component that gracefully handles both simple and complex navigation items
- Data structure that can grow with your portfolio needs

### Solution

Update `portfolio/_data/navigation.yml` with enhanced structure:

```yaml
- text: "HOME"
  url: "/"
  
- text: "UX/UI"
  url: "/ux-ui/"
  
- text: "DEVELOPMENT"
  url: "/development/"
  
- text: "VISUAL DESIGN"
  url: "/visual-design/"
  featured: true
  
- text: "PHOTOGRAPHY"
  url: "/photography/"
  
- text: "ABOUT"
  url: "/about/"
  
- text: "GET RESUME"
  url: "/resume/"
  external: true
  
- text: "GITHUB"
  url: "https://github.com/yourusername"
  external: true
  icon: "github"
```

**How Enhanced YAML Structure Works:**

The beauty of YAML is that **optional properties just get added**:

1. **Basic items** (like "HOME") only have `text` and `url`
2. **Enhanced items** add extra properties like `featured: true`
3. **Jekyll handles missing properties gracefully** - if an item doesn't have `icon`, then `item.icon` returns nothing

**What Jekyll Creates From This:**
```javascript
// Conceptually, Jekyll creates something like this:
[
  { text: "HOME", url: "/" },
  { text: "VISUAL DESIGN", url: "/visual-design/", featured: true },
  { text: "GITHUB", url: "https://github.com/...", external: true, icon: "github" }
]
```

Update `portfolio/_includes/components/nav-item.html` to handle enhanced data:

```html
<li class="nav-item{% if include.active %} active{% endif %}{% if include.featured %} featured{% endif %}">
  <a href="{{ include.url }}" 
     class="nav-link{% if include.icon %} has-icon{% endif %}"
     {% if include.external %}target="_blank" rel="noopener"{% endif %}
     {% if include.active %}aria-current="page"{% endif %}>
    
    {% if include.icon %}
      <span class="nav-icon nav-icon--{{ include.icon }}"></span>
    {% endif %}
    
    {{ include.text }}
    
    {% if include.external %}
      <span class="external-indicator" aria-label="Opens in new tab"></span>
    {% endif %}
  </a>
</li>
```

**How the Enhanced Component Logic Works:**

Let's break down the new conditional patterns:

**1. Multiple CSS Classes:**
```html
<li class="nav-item{% if include.active %} active{% endif %}{% if include.featured %} featured{% endif %}">
```
- **Pattern:** Each `{% if %}` conditionally adds a class
- **Result:** Could generate `class="nav-item"` or `class="nav-item active featured"`
- **Flexibility:** Any combination of classes based on the data

**2. Conditional Attributes:**
```html
{% if include.external %}target="_blank" rel="noopener"{% endif %}
```
- **`target="_blank"`** - Opens link in new tab
- **`rel="noopener"`** - Security measure that prevents new tab from accessing the original page
- **The pattern** - Both attributes only get added if `external: true` in the data

**3. Dynamic Class Generation:**
```html
<span class="nav-icon nav-icon--{{ include.icon }}"></span>
```
- **`{{ include.icon }}`** - Inserts the actual icon name from data
- **Result:** If `icon: "github"`, this becomes `class="nav-icon nav-icon--github"`
- **CSS targeting:** You can style `.nav-icon--github` specifically

**4. Nested Conditionals:**
```html
{% if include.icon %}
  <span class="nav-icon nav-icon--{{ include.icon }}"></span>
{% endif %}
```
- **Outer check:** Only create the icon span if an icon was specified
- **Inner content:** Use the icon name to create specific CSS classes
- **Safety:** Prevents empty `<span class="nav-icon nav-icon--">` if no icon exists

Update your navigation loop to pass the enhanced properties:

```html
<ul class="nav-list">
  {% for item in site.data.navigation %}
    {% assign is_active = false %}
    {% if page.url == item.url %}
      {% assign is_active = true %}
    {% endif %}
    
    {% include components/nav-item.html 
       url=item.url 
       text=item.text 
       active=is_active
       external=item.external
       featured=item.featured
       icon=item.icon %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

**How Enhanced Parameter Passing Works:**

**The Key Insight:** Jekyll handles missing properties gracefully:

- **If item has `external: true`** → `external=item.external` passes `true`
- **If item has no `external` property** → `external=item.external` passes `null`
- **In the component:** `{% if include.external %}` treats `null` as `false`

**What This Generates:**

For a basic item like "HOME":
```html
<li class="nav-item">
  <a href="/" class="nav-link">HOME</a>
</li>
```

For the enhanced "GITHUB" item:
```html
<li class="nav-item">
  <a href="https://github.com/yourusername" 
     class="nav-link has-icon" 
     target="_blank" 
     rel="noopener">
    <span class="nav-icon nav-icon--github"></span>
    GITHUB
    <span class="external-indicator" aria-label="Opens in new tab"></span>
  </a>
</li>
```

### Why This Approach

Enhanced data structures support complex requirements while maintaining simplicity for basic cases. Optional properties and conditional logic ensure backward compatibility while providing flexibility for future navigation needs.

### Challenge Questions

1. How do optional properties in data files support different types of navigation items?
2. Why use conditional logic in components rather than creating separate component types?
3. What are the benefits of planning for future data needs in your initial structure?

#### Answers

1. Optional properties let you specify additional behavior only when needed. Basic navigation items remain simple while complex items can include metadata like external links or icons, providing flexibility without complexity overhead.

2. Conditional logic keeps components unified and maintainable. Separate component types would create duplication and make consistent updates difficult. One flexible component handles all variations through data-driven configuration.

3. Planning for future needs prevents breaking changes later. Adding optional properties to your data structure from the start means you can enhance navigation functionality by updating data and templates, not by rebuilding the entire system.
