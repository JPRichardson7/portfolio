                    Growing up, I was surrounded by creativity. My mom taught piano from our house, took me to concerts and art museums, and filled our home with music of all kinds. But I was terrible with pencils and brushes—traditional art just didn't click for me.

                <p class="text-dark-blue!">
                    Everything changed when I discovered photography. Suddenly I could create something beautiful, but through the aid of a technical instrument. I was hooked. From there, I found audio engineering, then graphic design, and eventually code—each one revealing the same truth: I thrive where art meets technology, where creative vision is enhanced by technical expertise.

                    I design in Figma and Adobe Creative Suite, then increasingly implement those designs in code. I hand-code responsive layouts and build component-based systems—this portfolio site is built from scratch using Jekyll and custom CSS. Whether I'm designing brand campaigns, directing photography shoots, or building web interfaces, I approach every project with both creative vision and technical understanding.

                    Over the past decade, I ran a wedding photography business alongside full-time roles at Shor-Line and Faultless Brands. Managing that business taught me client relationship management, project scoping, timeline coordination, and how to balance creative vision with client expectations and budget realities. At Shor-Line and Faultless, I applied that same systematic thinking to enterprise creative work—establishing brand guidelines, creating reusable components, and designing for consistency across multiple touchpoints.

                    I understand the constraints that developers face because I write code myself. I appreciate the nuances that designers care about because I've spent years crafting pixel-perfect visual experiences. This combination—someone who can design beautiful interfaces AND implement them effectively—is what differentiates my approach. I'm bringing over a decade of creative problem-solving experience to building digital products that work beautifully for both users and the technology that performs them.
