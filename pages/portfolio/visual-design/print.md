   content='I rebuilt Shor-Line\'s 100+ page catalog by creating a comprehensive design system from scratch. Building a new grid structure, typography standards, and tabbed navigation brought order to their extensive SKU portfolio spanning tables, kennels, and cages. Using InDesign\'s Book feature, I directed a team of three designers to execute the system while maintaining consistency at scale. For the cover, I photographed and art directed a celebration of their American manufacturing heritage, then specified softtouch lamination with spot UV to make the welding sparks physically tactile—reinforcing quality through both visual and haptic experience. The catalog served as both a trade show marketing tool and sales resource for veterinary and boarding facilities nationwide.'

   content='Working with a 1960s Shor-Line table still in excellent condition, I created a visual narrative to demonstrate product longevity. I photographed the table in my studio, extracted it in Photoshop, then manually composited two contrasting environments showing the same table across six decades—a modern surgical space with clean blue tones above, and a vintage 1960s setting with period-appropriate grain and toning below. The dual-timeline approach let the product itself prove durability claims without relying on copy. I built both environments entirely through manual compositing and color grading techniques. Originally ran as a full-page print ad, later adapted as a half-spread in the catalog.'

   content='I designed promotional wraps to launch Shor-Line\'s new 4-color vinyl printing capability for kennel systems—a significant upgrade from their previous solid laminate and bare stainless steel options. I chose halftone grids and CMYK ink drips as the visual theme, creating a playful meta-reference to the printing process itself while demonstrating the vibrant customization now possible. The first design uses dramatic process color drips and bold halftones to grab attention, while the second applies the concept to a branded cat shelter environment, showing potential clients how the technology could create sophisticated, customized spaces. Both designs were printed on demo units and displayed at veterinary trade shows to showcase the new printing capabilities in person.'
