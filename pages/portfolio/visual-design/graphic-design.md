   content="I rebuilt Shor-Line\'s 100+ page catalog by creating a comprehensive design system from scratch. Building a new grid structure, typography standards, and tabbed navigation brought order to their extensive SKU portfolio spanning tables, kennels, and cages. Using InDesign\'s Book feature, I directed a team of three designers to execute the system while maintaining consistency at scale. For the cover, I photographed and art directed a celebration of their American manufacturing heritage, then specified softtouch lamination with spot UV to make the welding sparks physically tactile—reinforcing quality through both visual and haptic experience. The catalog served as both a trade show marketing tool and sales resource for veterinary and boarding facilities nationwide."

   content="Shor-Line needed to showcase their new 4-color vinyl printing capability for veterinary kennel systems at trade shows—a major upgrade from their previous solid laminate and bare stainless steel options. Using halftone grids and CMYK ink drips as the visual theme, I developed a playful meta-reference to the printing process itself that would immediately communicate the customization possibilities. The first wrap uses dramatic process color drips for maximum impact, while the second demonstrates how veterinary practices and shelters could create branded environments. Both designs were printed on demo units for veterinary trade show displays."

   content="Researching the workers and steel infrastructure of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, I compiled and rewrote content from multiple historical sources into a cohesive hardcover publication. The tactile metal-textured cover reinforces the industrial subject matter, while screw-post binding provided both structural integrity and thematic resonance. I developed experimental spreads built on an underlying grid system, using each layout to complement the historical content while letting Rockwell's bold geometry dominate—allowing the typography itself to convey the strength and precision of steel construction without competing graphic elements."

   content='Working with a 1960s Shor-Line table still in excellent condition, I created a visual narrative to demonstrate product longevity. I photographed the table in my studio, extracted it in Photoshop, then manually composited two contrasting environments showing the same table across six decades—a modern surgical space with clean blue tones above, and a vintage 1960s setting with period-appropriate grain and toning below. The dual-timeline approach let the product itself prove durability claims without relying on copy. I built both environments entirely through manual compositing and color grading techniques. Originally ran as a full-page print ad, later adapted as a half-spread in the catalog.'

   content="Shor-Line launched their first LED exam light to replace traditional halogen fixtures in veterinary practices, promoting it through digital ads in industry publications. I designed a web banner that integrated the light fixture into the typography—replacing the I in LIGHT to maximize product visibility while maintaining visual interest. I chose cool brand colors (blues rather than orange) to reinforce the LED's temperature benefits and pushed for a cleaner, more modern layout despite pressure to include heavy copy. I photographed the prototype unit and retouched it for use across multiple banner sizes."
