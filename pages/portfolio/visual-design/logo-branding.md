   content="I rebuilt Shor-Line\'s 100+ page catalog by creating a comprehensive design system from scratch. Building a new grid structure, typography standards, and tabbed navigation brought order to their extensive SKU portfolio spanning tables, kennels, and cages. Using InDesign\'s Book feature, I directed a team of three designers to execute the system while maintaining consistency at scale. For the cover, I photographed and art directed a celebration of their American manufacturing heritage, then specified softtouch lamination with spot UV to make the welding sparks physically tactile—reinforcing quality through both visual and haptic experience. The catalog served as both a trade show marketing tool and sales resource for veterinary and boarding facilities nationwide."

   content="Shor-Line needed to showcase their new 4-color vinyl printing capability for veterinary kennel systems at trade shows—a major upgrade from their previous solid laminate and bare stainless steel options. Using halftone grids and CMYK ink drips as the visual theme, I developed a playful meta-reference to the printing process itself that would immediately communicate the customization possibilities. The first wrap uses dramatic process color drips for maximum impact, while the second demonstrates how veterinary practices and shelters could create branded environments. Both designs were printed on demo units for veterinary trade show displays."
