   content="I created a complete brand identity for the National Museum of Computing, building the system from the ground up. The logo's letterforms worked so well that I expanded them into a full custom display typeface called Circuitry, designed to evoke circuit board traces and chip terminals. This allowed the brand to reference its vintage computing roots while maintaining a bold, modern aesthetic—avoiding generic "retro tech" fonts in favor of something proprietary and strategically ownable. The system included brand guidelines, business collateral, environmental signage, and promotional applications."

   content='I built JPShots to operate in both wedding and commercial photography markets—requiring a brand identity strong enough for corporate clients yet approachable for brides in a market dominated by soft, script logos. I designed a geometric mark using the currency symbol (¤) as foundation, which naturally resembles a camera lens and mount. The yellow lens center sits within black crosshair elements referencing vintage lens mounts, while radial "shots" echo lens barrel markings. Brand touchpoints included transparent business cards—a material choice that stood out in a market of traditional paper stock while echoing the optical glass central to photography. The bold construction stayed legible from trade show booths to favicons, differentiating through technical confidence without alienating wedding clients.'
