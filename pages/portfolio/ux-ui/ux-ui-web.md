   content="Led UI design and information architecture for a national veterinary equipment manufacturer transitioning from a 15-year-old interface to a modern <span class='code-text'>BigCommerce</span> platform. The challenge was serving five distinct user types—veterinarians needing technical specifications, purchasing staff seeking accessible overviews, architects planning facilities, boarders/groomers evaluating equipment, and shelter administrators with budget constraints.

   Working collaboratively with an external agency and internal marketing director, I developed the core design system in <span class='code-text'>Sketch</span>: Montserrat typography hierarchy, deep blue with orange/teal accents conveying premium American manufacturing heritage, and a modular card-based layout. I designed the homepage, product category pages, and user-specific landing pages (Veterinary, Boarding, Grooming, Architect, Shelter), tailoring content and imagery to each audience's needs.

   A key UX challenge was the Technical Support page, designed to reduce call volume for two overwhelmed support representatives. I created a self-service hub surfacing the most common issue—scale calibration—alongside video tutorials and parts access, allowing customers to resolve issues independently. I advocated for streamlined search UX but worked within technical constraints requiring dual search bars due to platform integration limitations. The modernized site I designed remains live today, serving customers nationwide."

   content="I designed and coded fixed-width <span class='code-text'>HTML</span> emails for Shor-Line's subscriber base across veterinary, kennel, grooming, and humane practice segments. I built a reusable component system for buttons and layout blocks to streamline production across multiple campaign types. I varied section backgrounds to maintain visual interest while keeping images minimal (one per section) to improve deliverability and accommodate copy-heavy content. The primary challenge was achieving polished, on-brand design while working within strict email client limitations and outdated rendering engines, particularly <span class='code-text'>Outlook on Windows</span>."
