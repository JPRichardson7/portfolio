   content="At Faultless Brands, I produced lifestyle photography for their consumer product lines, blending technical precision with creative direction. I handled location scouting and arrived on-site with pre-designed comps and styled props, allowing for efficient execution while maintaining creative flexibility.

   The technical challenge was balancing available light with supplemental strobes and continuous lighting to create natural-looking scenes that still gave me full control over the final image. I also utilized view camera techniques - the tilt-shift movements let me maintain clean perspective on interior spaces while keeping the product presentation ideal. This approach delivered the polished, magazine-quality aesthetic the brand needed while avoiding the overly-stylized look that can make lifestyle photography feel artificial."
