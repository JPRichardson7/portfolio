   content="I created a complete brand identity for the National Museum of Computing, building the system from the ground up. The logo's letterforms worked so well that I expanded them into a full custom display typeface called Circuitry, designed to evoke circuit board traces and chip terminals. This allowed the brand to reference its vintage computing roots while maintaining a bold, modern aesthetic. I avoiding generic 'retro tech' fonts in favor of something proprietary and strategically ownable. The system included brand guidelines, business collateral, environmental signage, and promotional applications."
